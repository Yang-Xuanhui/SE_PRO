# **Comparation between Native app, Web app and Hybrid app**

![relationship of native, web and hybrid apps] (./relationship.png "relationship")

## **NATIVE**

Based on the **local operating systems** of smart phones, such as iOS, Android and WP.They are third-party applications using native programs to write and run. The commonly developed languages are **Java**, **C++**, etc.

## **WEB**

Web App is a kind of framework type of App development mode (HTML5 App framework development mode).It is **based on browser**.

This pattern usually consists of  two sections, "HTML5 cloud website" and "App client". The App application clients only need to install the application of framework part, and the application goes to the cloud to fetch data to mobile phone users every time users open the App.

## **HYBRID**

Hybrid App is **a combination of Native App and Web App**. It is to build a browser in the Native App to render the appropriate functional pages in the form of web pages.There are a lot of apps that are starting to adopt this approach, such as the Subscriptions in WeChat, which is presented as a Web page.

News APP and video APP generally adopt Native framework and Web content.

## **Pros & Cons**

![compare] (./compare.png "compare")
* Native
  
  + Advantages:

    1. Provide the best user experience, the best user interface, smooth interaction
    2. Local resources can be accessed
    3. Mobile hardware devices, such as cameras and microphones, can be called

  + Disadvantages:
  
    1. High development costs.

       Each mobile operating system needs independent development projects to provide different experiences for different platforms.
    2. Slow release of new releases.
    
       Downloads are user controlled, and many users don't want to download updates (for example, there are still many 1.0 users and you may have to maintain the 1.0 API).
    3. App store release review cycle is long.
    
       Android takes between one and three days, while iOS takes longer
* Web
  
   + Advantages:
  
        1. No need to install the package
        2. Overall light weight, low development cost
        3. The user is not required to update manually. The app developer will update directly in the background, and the new version will be pushed to the user, which is more convenient for business development
        4. Browser-based, cross-platform
   + Disadvantages:

        1. The page jumps arduous, unsteady sense is stronger.
   
           When the speed of the network is limited, there are many times when the card or card dead phenomenon, interaction effect is limited
        2. Security is relatively low and data can be easily compromised or hijacked
* Hybrid
  
    + Such apps combine the advantages of Native and Web apps:
  
        1. On the premise of realizing more functions, the app installation package should not be too large
        2. Open a web page within the application without the hassle of jumping to the browser
        3. When the main functional areas are relatively stable, the added functional areas adopt web form, which makes the iteration more convenient
    + Hybrid App strives to create an experience similar to Native App, but it is still limited by many factors, such as technology, network speed, etc. It is't perfect.
